Created Firestore cloud database (chose the free version of Firebase), and configured service key as a .json file, which I have placed inside of cfg folder
Created basic features, such as being able to create a user, and basic login verification
Created users Collection on Firestore, and made each user have their own Document, which contains vital login info
such as their password, and other fields which will be added later
Firestore database can be found at: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/vocabventuredb/firestore/databases/-default-/data/
Our team can track the status of our database in real time through link
