Implemented two previously defined functions that would check the user's status and update it 
if they were online. The next function retrieves the user's data to correctly match their progress
(# of words they have learned, bosses defeated...). I also implemented a new function that will update 
the collection of learned words the user has come across after they have learned them by speaking to an NPC. 
Luckily Firebase allows for realtime updates which will help in both performance and debugging.

Created the totalWords database on Firebase which consists of all the words that we will be incorporating
into our game. Each document is named as the English word with two fields for French and Spanish that 
correspond to the actual translation

Updated Learned_Words function to represent the newly updated database structures for total words and the 
users collections.
