Implemented two previously defined functions that would check the user's status and update it 
if they were online. The next function retrieves the user's data to correctly match their progress
(# of words they have learned, bosses defeated...). I also implemented a new function that will update 
the collection of learned words the user has come across after they have learned them by speaking to an NPC. 
Luckily Firebase allows for realtime updates which will help in both performance and debugging.
